# Radio Button Buttons

<p class="datestamp">July 9, 2014</p>

It happened that I was working on the design of a registration form at work when Luke Wroblewski posted on Google+ about “[Button inputs](https://plus.google.com/+LukeWroblewski/posts/VDWUbxMcJuD)”. I was working with radio inputs instead of buttons, but the idea is the same.

The point is that tapping buttons is easier for mobile users than dropdowns, never mind text inputs. What I was working on was styling radio buttons with a more button-like feel, with nice touch targets and states. In fact, a lot of our focus these days at work is thinking about everything in terms of touch-first (a variant of mobile-first, specifically about interface design).

Check out the jsfiddle for [Tappable radio buttons](http://jsfiddle.net/jorgeluis/jAwh8/). (These still need a lot of polish)
