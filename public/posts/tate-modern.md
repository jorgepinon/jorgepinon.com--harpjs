We visited London last Thanksgiving (Paris, the year before), and I took an afternoon to see the Tate. The scale of the central chimney of the [former power station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankside_Power_Station) is awe inspiring. It didnâ€™t seem real to me from any perspective or distance.

This is one of my few photos showing such obvious 3-point perspective.
