# Disable java on Mac OS browsers

<p class="datestamp">August 29, 2012</p>

Christian Heilmann (aka [@codepo8](https://twitter.com/codepo8)) put together a nice little list of typical Mac OS browsers and [how to disable java](http://christianheilmann.com/2012/08/29/how-to-disable-java-in-all-your-browsers-on-osx-screencast/) in each. There's a screencast as well but the bullet points are simple enough. I found a couple of other plugins that I turned off while I was in there too.
