# Letter to U.S. Immigrants

<p class="datestamp">January 9, 2017</p>

To all current and potential U.S. immigrants,

I think you should know these three things:

- A few of us are racists or at least xenophobic. I’m sure the same is true wherever you’re from, but we have a long history of mixing races and cultures – including a couple of centuries of [slavery](http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/slavery) – so it’s different here. This group of Americans will never want you here, but don’t think this makes you special. They feel the same about many other immigrants before you, too. Unfortunately you and your children, and maybe your grandchildren, will have to confront this prejudice from time to time. American laws and [government services](https://www.uscis.gov/) are established to help and protect you.  

- Many more of us will welcome you. Most Americans remember being immigrants themselves, or are maybe just naturally open to other cultures. Those Americans understand that the U.S. has always had a mix of cultures, which is our major strength and the reason for our global popularity. 

- Bring your culture but also accept ours. Continue your own ethnic and family traditions and share them with others. Create your own communities. Many of us do. But the payment for living in America is to accept American traditions and civic responsibility. The more you do that, the better off we’ll all be. America is a land of mixed cultures and always will be. Add yours to the mix, and teach your children to do the same.

We’re all here trying to make our lives and country better and you can participate in that.
