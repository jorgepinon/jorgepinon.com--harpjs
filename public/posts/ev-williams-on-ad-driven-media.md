# Ev Williams on Ad-Driven Media

<p class="datestamp">January 20, 2017</p>

Medium laid off about 50 employees, mostly in the ad revenue group. Ev Williams, the CEO, published a [blog post](https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be) about it that explained that their ad-driven revenue model -- the same model that drives most media sites on the web -- is broken and unsustainable to run a business.

> Upon further reflection, it’s clear that the broken system is ad-driven media on the internet. It simply doesn’t serve people. In fact, it’s not designed to. The vast majority of articles, videos, and other “content” we all consume on a daily basis is paid for — directly or indirectly — by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals. And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get…well, what we get. And it’s getting worse.

I’m sure there are people out there looking to solve this problem, but until anything better comes along, publishers are going to keep failing on the business side if all they're going to hope for is ad revenue to sustain it. Publishing needs to move to a subscription model, with ads making up a smaller part of the revenue, just like sports teams rely on season ticket sales to provide a stable revenue base.

Until that happens, web publishing is going to be a volatile business.
